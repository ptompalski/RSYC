\title{Predict Aboveground Biomass Using RSYC models}
\usage{
predict_rsyc(tile_id, age, species)
}
\arguments{
\item{tile_id}{A character string specifying the tile ID. Must match a tile for which RSYC models are available.}

\item{age}{A numeric vector of stand ages (in years) at which to predict biomass. All values must be positive.}

\item{species}{A character string specifying the species code (e.g., \code{"PICE.MAR"} for black spruce).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of predicted AGB values (e.g., in tonnes per hectare) corresponding to the input ages.
}
\description{
This function generates aboveground biomass (AGB) predictions using remote sensing-based yield curves (RSYC) for a given species, stand age, and tile.
It retrieves the model parameters associated with the specified tile and species and applies a four-parameter Chapman-Richards growth function.
}
\details{
The RSYC models were developed using data from 0 to 150 years. If any ages provided exceed 150, a warning is issued because predictions represent extrapolations beyond the model's calibration range and may be unreliable.

\examples{
predict_rsyc(tile_id = "J11", age = 1:100, species = "PICE.MAR")
